# jusDNCE vNext

This folder hosts an isolated, parallel app root used for experimentation with new
components, services, and engine layers without touching the current production UI.

## Run (development)

```bash
npm run dev:vnext
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build:vnext
```

The build outputs to `dist-vnext/` so the current app build remains untouched.
