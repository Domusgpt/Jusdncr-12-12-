# Dev Track Log

## 2026-01-03T21:29:16Z
- Initialized session; reviewed root AGENTS instructions for deployment tooling expectations.
- Created `docs/systematic_plan.md` outlining phased execution across monetization, cost modeling, player evolution, packaging, compliance, and launch QA.
- Next: build cost input sheet + calculator scaffold and reconstitute credit/paywall middleware with Stripe + Firebase hooks under feature flags.

## 2026-01-03T21:48:27Z
- Reviewed pricing requirements (offer everything for sale), QR code ask, bug-reporting in Help, and terminology change to Golems/DKGs.
- Added `docs/pricing_model.md` capturing simplified tiers (Trial → Starter Export → Golem Packs/DKGs → Pro), QR system, bug intake, and naming checklist.
- Updated `docs/systematic_plan.md` and `BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md` to align phases and pricing strategy with the new model and calculator PR references.
- Next: propagate Golem/DKG terminology into UI copy and paywall flows, wire QR + bug-report endpoints, and sync pricing calculator inputs with Stripe/Firebase mirrors.
